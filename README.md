# Stereo Object Detection with Disparity Depth Estimation

This project processes stereo video captured from a ZED camera to perform real-time object detection using a YOLO model, combined with depth estimation using stereo disparity maps. The output includes bounding boxes with estimated distances and an optional video output.
